Are we on track to meet deadlines (display GANTT chart) | 1) **Nilesh** did the roll call. </br> </br> **Cheryl** is in training this week until the 13th. </br> </br> 2) **Dr. Richards** asked for the status of the ATO documents' signatures. </br> **Bobbi** mentioned she will sign after the SO has approved them and signed them. </br> </br> **Tom** explained that SO wants to wait for his final review until after the scans screenshots are incorporated in the documents.  </br> </br> 3)  **Dr. Richards** insisted that SO should sign as the architecture of VAM will not change from environment to environment.  RPC Mirror and ROC Monitor Code will not change either.  Only thing that may change are the ports and its mapping.  </br> </br> 4) **Bobbi** mentioned that there will be a difference in the architecture.  **Tom** explained that it is true that the code being built by the development team will be stable.  However, in AWS environment, the entire pre-production instance will be built in a way that it mimics the production environment.  In order to do so, his team is creating a VPC in Cloud that has EC2 Redhat Linux servers.  This is the OIS layer.  The Kubernetes that sits on top of the EC2 are the Runtime Orchestration layer. And the RPC Mirror and Monitor will be the pods on top of Kubernetes. This environment is auto scalable horizontally and vertically using the Autoscaling group. Also the EC2 Load Balancer directs the traffic appropriately as per the pre-determined thresholds. It will also have the IBM BigFix and Splunk deployed in this environment. </br> </br>  4) **Conor** mentioned that there is no customization of the AWS Consoles and there is no GUI for VAM.  </br> **Tom** mentioned that we still need to build the environments so proper scans are provided by the CSOC for ATO. and the Autoscaling that his team is building has CubeControl too. </br>  </br> 5) **Conor** mentioned that Build 4 was delivered on 06-07-2019 |
