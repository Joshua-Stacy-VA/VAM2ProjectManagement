| 3. | Key Points </br>  1. high level summaries will be presented for:  </br>  a. Management  </br>  b. Technical  </br> </br> 2. Agenda for each track:  </br>  i. Overview of progress  </br> ii. What was accomplished in the prior week </br> iii. What is planned for the coming week </br>  iv.	Are we on track to meet deadlines (display GANTT chart) | 1.  Meeting Cancelled due to unavailability of multiple team members. However, the meeting notes have been updated to provide status in lieu of the meeting. </br> </br> 2. VAM currently has everything in place for the Risk Management Framework (RMF) process in eMASS. <ul> <li> It is currently in stage 3 (See attachment of status in eMASS) awaiting ISSO (Bobbi) approval, to then moved up to be approved by the Case Manager (Stasia). </li> <li>  Once all of the stages (See attachment of RMP process) have been met, a more accurate date of ATO package submission can be realized. </li> </li> Bobbi stated that she will be approving stage 3 this afternoon. </li> </ul> 3.  Also note: The AOSB (The ATO package review board) is not yet ready to accept/review ATO packages until either late September or early October. <ul> <li> They are still learning the ATO package requirements as a result of the new eMASS requirements. </li> <li> So, no matter when we submit, the ATO package will sit idle until ASOB is ready. </li> </ul> 4.  Also Note: Given that there are still eMASS SOPs and requirements still in their evolution phase (Ex: POAM SOP, Privacy SOP),  VAM’s eMASS instance will be without these until they are provided by the VA. <ul> <li> Whether or not this effects the package, we are uncertain at this time. </li> <li> Regardless, they will be quickly updated (If need be) once guidance is received. </li> </ul> 5.  Additionally, we are waiting on ISSO approval of the DRP/CP test/training slides (Sent last week) to then be sent to the associating members of the project, and to then setup a meeting time to complete that compliance requirement. |
