# DRAFT

## SUMMARY
AbleVets team had uploaded all required documents including the POAM for final ATO submission before the freeze of RV on July 14, 2019.

Our team had to wait for eMASS training and RV to eMASS transition from July 14, 2019 to July 29, 2019.  

During the eMASS training, we learned of the new ATO package approval submission in eMASS. We determined that unlike RiskVision, eMASS requires at least twice as many steps in the approval process, which in-effect, incurs more dependency on VA availability. In other words, there is a greater chance of delay due to being dependent upon others and their schedules (PTO, training, common work and etc) in getting approvals to receive an ATO in eMASS compared to RiskVision. Additionally,  we learned that the entire VA network staff related to eMASS is also learning this new system, thus creating further delay. Moreover,  given the number of systems transitioning from RiskVision to eMASS, currently the staff required in the approval process of an ATO is limited. 

During the training we determined that the estimated time it takes for an ATO process in eMASS, from start to finish, is about 9 months at the least.  Now, this is based on a system just starting out. For us and factoring everything we stated above, we estimated that our process till ATO approval is at least 3-4 months if not more. 

So, this prompted us to dig further into figuring out a way to avoid this new delay, which resulted in us understanding the process of a conditional 1-year ATO. And decided to get the SO, ISO, VA PM, and BO to accept the 1-year ATO instead, which was initially considered a conditional ATO of 30 or 120 days, but it is now a single year conditional ATO. 
The 1-year ATO are typically for projects which need to address specific concerns at a faster rate (Escalated) for whatever reason, and our reason is sufficient, since the eMASS migration could and likely hinder our ability to complete an ATO in time before IOC and/or possibly the contract end date. 

The 1-year conditional ATO will essentially shotgun through the normal approval process and save us roughly 3-4 months at the minimum. However, the VA can still disapprove our ATO, but given the work done in RV and the amount of counseling that we have had from our ISO, we see no reason why that will happen, because we will have everything needed for a conditional approval from the Authorizing Official (AO) in eMASS. Even with a denial, we will still be able to resubmit for the 1-year conditional ATO and make better time than the normal ATO process.

## Timeline of accomplishments in RV:
1.	Around July XX, 2019 AbleVets had all the documents completed and uploaded in RV with all required signatures.
2.	There was an issue with the Secure/Quality Scans with the way the RPC calls are being made.  AbleVets team worked with the ISO, BO and the technical team to document proper response to the accepted risks of the RPC traffic in question through a POAM in RV.
3.	AbleVets decided to create and upload a POAM for the Nessus Scan as it was taking long for VA to run the scans.
4.	AbleVets created multiple POAM’s for scans that were not required for VAM ATO. (We can chose to list) all of the docs.
5.	Around July xx, AbleVets SUBMITs the ATO package  (minus the POAM’s) for ISO team’s review.
6.	AbleVets learns through ISO and her team on July xx, that the ASOB stopped reviewing ATOs across VA on July 11, 2019 
7.	During the same meeting, ISO advises that RiskVision will be turned into a Read-Only mode tool from July 14, 2019
8.	AbleVets Security Engineer completed his eMASS training on July 31, 2019 
9.	VA completed the RiskVision to EMASS migration on July 29, 2019 
10.	AbleVets’ Security Engineer’s System Steward access re-activated for eMASS on August 02, 2019 (Still Waiting on one more AbleVets Security Engineer to regain System Steward access)
11.	eMASS recategorizes VAM on August 08, 2019 as ???? (No new signatures required)
