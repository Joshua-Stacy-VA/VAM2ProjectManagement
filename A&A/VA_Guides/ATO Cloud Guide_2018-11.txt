OFFICE OF INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGYOffice of Information SecurityVA Cloud Authority to Operate Process Summary1  BackgroundObtaining an Authority to Operate (ATO) for a cloud-leveraged Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) information system changes the ATO process applied historically at VA. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) have gone to great lengths to secure their infrastructure, utilizing world-class security tools and employing in-house security teams with deep expertise. Most importantly, CSP’s use a shared responsibility model for providing defense-in-depth security.As detailed in Figure 1 below, the specific cloud service delivery mechanisms that a customer selects (whether on-premises, IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) will define and determine customer-specific responsibilities.Figure 1:  Shared Responsibility for different Cloud Service Modes  https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/iaas-vs-paas-vs-saas/There are three primary cloud service models based on the NIST SP 800-145, The NIST Definition ofCloud Computing:•	Software as a Service (SaaS) - The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure.•	Platform as a Service (PaaS) - The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider•	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer can deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications.
Customers deploying in the VA Enterprise Cloud (VAEC) can take advantage of the shared responsibility model and accelerate more secure deployment of IT assets and accelerate the ATO process.Specifically, customers utilizing the shared-responsibility model can take advantage of control inheritance. The CSPs are responsible for ensuring they have gone through the FedRAMP process and obtained an ATO. As part of the FedRAMP process, the CSP will document in the Controls Implementation Summary (CIS) the responsibilities of the CSPs and the customer. The majority of VA cloud-leveraged systems will rely on not only their own ATO but the ATO of their Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and the ATO of the VA Enterprise Cloud (VAEC) with each representing a potential source of security control inheritance.The VAEC provides a set of common General Support Services (GSS) to simplify support and development. The services that are part of the VA GSS ATO provided to within the VAEC Azure an AWS deployments are the following:•	Common Serviceso Active Directoryo PKI Serviceso Ansibleo Backupo CA Unified Infrastructure Management (CA UIM)o Disaster Recoveryo GitHubo Jump Boxeso SMTP Relays•	Security and Scanning Toolso BigFixo McAfee (HIPS, HIDS, Antivirus)o Nessuso Splunk2  PurposeThis document is intended to standardize the process flow and expectations for obtaining ATO for a VA cloud-leveraged system. It will be enhanced in future iterations to standardize the process flow for authorizing individual cloud services including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) which presents unique challenges of its own. Linked to the process flow are potential metrics that can bemeasured and presented during Planning, Migration, and Operation of the VA cloud-leveraged information system. It will also be updated as the VA migrates from RiskVision to eMASS for RMF assessment recording.
3  Scope

The VA Enterprise Cloud (VAEC) CSP Environments have a US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) High Certified VA ATO. VAEC provides access to the FedRAMP certified services of each CSP.The ATO for an application or system residing in the VAEC is separate from the VAEC CSP Environment ATO. Each project team is responsible for its application or system level ATO.System Owners and Information Security Officers (ISO) will follow the Risk Management Framework for VA Information System (VA Handbook 6500). This guide presents the overall process flow to achieve an ATO for a VA cloud-leveraged information system. The process is linkedto the RMF as described above and contains distinct procedures to ensure the appropriate securityconcerns and compliance requirements are considered throughout the RMF. Currently, the VA utilizes RiskVision (https://vaww.grc.va.gov/spc/page.jsp) as their Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) tool to capture security and compliance requirements.VA has partnered with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to transition to a new GRC tool. This tool, Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS) is a web-based Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) service for Risk Management Framework (RMF) Assessment andAuthorization activities. DISA will deploy and maintain eMASS on behalf of the VA.Please refer to the VAEC CSP’s website (VAEC Site) to determine which services are in scope and have been fully assessed by third party auditors, resulting in a FedRAMP Certification, attestation of compliance, or ATO.Customers deploying in the VAEC can take advantage of the common controls that are being provided by the CSP, VAEC, and from the VA to accelerate more secure deployment of IT assets and accelerate the ATO process. Common controls are security controls whose implementation results in a security capability that is inheritable by one or more organizational information systems. The inheritable controls from the CSP have been assessed with an accredited Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) as part of the FedRAMP ATO process. This means the SystemOwner has less controls that they are responsible for implementing and validating. This will help toaccelerate the authorization process.When submitting an authorization package within RiskVision, the ISO will work with the SystemOwner to provide guidance on those controls that are inheritable and do not require a response.Figure 2 Controls Inheritance Summary4  VA Cloud ATO Process – VA Cloud-Leveraged SystemThe overview provided below illustrates the Risk Management Framework (RMF) process to obtain a system-specific ATO when the system leverages a cloud service (or multiple cloud services). The process flow follows the NIST and VA RMF by identifying specific procedural tasks for each of the following RMF steps (as applicable):1.   Categorize2.   Select3.   Implement4.   Assess5.   Authorize6.   MonitorFigure 3 Risk Management Framework (RMF)Note: As this is a document specific to the process and procedures required to achieve ATO for cloud services and VA cloud-leveraged information systems, the processes associated with implementation and assessment are abbreviated while referencing the appropriate legacy process for completing the action.The System Owner, ISO, and other designated stewards must complete the following to successfully submit for an Authorization package (see  Appendix A – Cloud ATO Checklist):??Designate an Information Security Officer and coordinate assignment of an Enterprise Program Management Office (EPMO) Information Assurance (IA) Security Analyst (see  Section 5.1)??Submit for a Veteran -Focused Integration Process Request (VIPR) ID (see Section5.2)??Complete the RiskVision (to be replaced by eMASS) System Inventory Checklist (seeSection 5.3)??Register with the VA Software Assurance Program Office (see  Section 5.4)??Submit for a Secure Design Review (see  Section 5.5)??Submit a Privacy Threshold Analysis to determine if a Privacy Impact Analysis (PIA)is required (see  Section 5.6 and Section 6.1.5)??Prepare PIA if required (see  Section 5.6)??Prepare System Security Plan (see Section 6.1.1)??Prepare Incident Response Plan (see  Section 6.1.2)??Prepare Disaster Recovery Plan (see  Section 6.1.3)??Prepare Information Security Contingency Plan (ISCP) (see  Section 6.1.4)??Prepare Interconnection Security Agreement/Memorandum of Understanding (seeSection 6.1.6)??Prepare Configuration Management Plan (see  Section 6.1.7)??Prepare Signatory Authority document (see Section 6.1.8)??Document control implementation evidence in RiskVision (or eMASS) (see Section6.1.9)??Prepare Risk Assessment (see  Section 6.1.10)??Request Nessus Scan (see  Section 6.2.1)??If project includes a database, schedule Database scan (see  Section 6.2.2)??Request Quality Code Review validation (see Section 6.2.3)??Request Secure Code Review validation (see Section 6.2.4)??Request Penetration Test/Web Application Security Assessment (see Section 6.2.5)??Request Security Compliance Configuration Data (SCCD) scan (see  Section 6.2.6)??Prepare Plan of Action and Milestones (see  Section 6.3)??Prepare Authorizing Official System Brief (AOSB) to be submitted with ATO Packet(see  Section 6.4)For the ATO to be reviewed for authorization by the VA, the package must be completed and uploaded into RiskVision and progressed to “CA Provide Certification Recommendation” no less than 45 calendar days before the date of the requested authorization decision.

When conducting the Nessus Scan, a discovery scan to identify all assets within the authorization boundary must be conducted as a part of the vulnerability scan (a discovery scan will not enumerate any vulnerabilities). All Critical and High deficiencies should be mitigated with documented mitigation evidence provided, and Moderate and Low deficiencies should be mitigated or have a documented mitigation plan.The System Owner or delegate will need to request a Nessus scan. Once the request is completed, CPO will work with ISRM/CSOC to determine if a separate supplemental vulnerability scan shall be conducted or authentication information for the non-Windows devices (e.g., SSH credentials for Linus/Unix servers) be added to the existing monthly predictive scan (conducted by NSOC).Upload the results to the Documents tab within RiskVision when results are sent to you. Next, please provide the IP Ranges to ISRM, so the applicable Nessus data can be entered in TVM within RiskVision.If a system’s Nessus Scan data is not currently displayed in the TVM within RiskVision, refer to theTVM guidance material located on the OIS portal.Once the system’s Nessus Scan data is accurately shown in TVM within RiskVision, System Owner or delegate needs to follow these steps:a) Browse to Nessus Enterprise Web Tool (NEWT) and use the Remediation Effort Entry Form (REEF) to document your manual remediation effort. For each deficiency identified from the scan, the System Owner or delegate creates a response within REEF for mitigating the deficiencies and / or provides evidence that the deficiencies have been mitigated. Also, include the scheduled completion date and status of each deficiency within REEF.b) Once all manual remediation has been documented within REEF, run this report https://spsites.cdw.va.gov/sites/FODW_PVT/Progress%20Reports/Progress_ReportbyRe gion_Chart.rdl within NEWT.c) Export the report by going to the upper left side of the screen select the Actions Menu.Choose Export and select Excel. Save the file.d)  System Owner or delegate then uploads the report from step 3 above to the Documents tab within RiskVision.  Mitigation information can also be provided in the Vulnerabilities tab within RiskVision.e) Within the uploaded mitigation strategy, each system should conduct an analysis on the results of the vulnerability scans to determine and document those findings that are false positives, not applicable to the system, or otherwise mitigated. Additionally, findings that must be remediated through or from the vendor should also be documented as part of this analysis.Continuous Monitoring Requirement – CSOC conducts predictive Nessus vulnerability scans monthly.  A supplemental scan is required for A&A purposes when requested by OIS, CSOC, and/or when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported. To maintain the authorization decision, the system must meet this continuous monitoring requirement.Nessus Links:	Nessus Scan Request: https://vaww.portal2.va.gov/sites/infosecurity/ca/Lists/Supplemental%20Sca n%20Request/AllItems.aspxOIS Portal GRC Training:https://vaww.portal2.va.gov/sites/infosecurity/projects/GRC%20Tool/GRC%20Tool%20Training%20Materials/Forms/AllItems.aspxNessus Enterprise Web Tool (NEWT:https://spsites.cdw.va.gov/sites/FODW_PVT/E-mail Address:	ISRM: vaoisisrmrmf@va.gov6.2.2 Database ScanIf this project includes a database host, a full database scan must be scheduled with the VA-CSOC. Once the database scan results are received, all findings should be mitigated and/or have a documented remediation strategy with expected mitigation date uploaded to Documents tab within RiskVision.To maintain the authorization decision for the system, any findings must be remediated within the approved timelines for the severity of the findings, and a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be created in RiskVision to keep track of the remediation effort. Database scans can be requested by visiting the link listed below.If a Database scan is not applicable, upload document to the documents tab explaining why aDatabase scan is not applicable.Continuous Monitoring Requirement – The Database scan must be conducted on an annual basis or when a significant change to the configuration.

E-mail Address:	Database Scanning Team:  VANSOCDBScans@va.gov6.2.3 Verification & Validation (V&V) Quality Code ReviewQuality code reviews of VA enterprise applications are conducted during development. Quality code reviews conducted during development are performed both during component testing and during A&A processes. If the application has not be registered, then the VA Application Developer will need to open a VA National Service Desk (NSD) ticket to register their application with the VA SwA Program Office.V&V reviews are conducted during the A&A process to obtain an Authority to Operate (ATO) or Temporary Authority to Operate (TATO). VA Application Developers scan their own application source code and deliver the scan results to the VA SwA Program Office for review.•	Subject: "Request quality code review validation"•	Body: Include the Application-ID and attach the V&V Quality Code Review Request Form

6.2.4 Secure Code Review
Secure code reviews of custom developed VA applications using the approved VA static code analysis tool should be conducted to identify vulnerabilities, coding, and design flaws within VA applications. Applications written in languages that are not supported, such as MUMPS, shall be targeted for manual review of testing with other applicable tools. If a Secure Code Review is not applicable, upload a document to the Documents tab within RiskVision explaining why a Secure Code Review is not applicable.Note there are two types of code reviews, which are not the same and are not interchangeable from an authorization perspective. There are different, separate A&A SOP technical/testing requirements for each. Secure code review has to do with following up mainly on potential critical and high severity findings. Compared to quality code review which has to do with following up on potential quality-specific findings.As part of the process for the secure code review, the Fortify .fpr scan file(s) and zip(s) of scanned code  to your applications will need to be uploaded to the report directory on the VA network.  An email will need to be sent  to the OIS Software  Assurance  with the Secure  Code Request form attached, and the following:•	Subject: "Request secure code review validation"•	Body: Please include the Application-ID and attach the Secure Code Review Request form.Continuous Monitoring Requirement – The Secure Design Review must be updated on an Annual Basis or when a significant change in the system or a major change in the application architecture occurs. (A&A SOP, 4.2.11)

The CSOC Penetration Test / NSOC Web Application Security Assessment (WASA) must be uploaded in the Documents tab on RiskVision and updated Annually.Continuous Monitoring Requirement – A CSOC Penetration Test / CSOC WASA is required on an Annual Basis to maintain an ATO and/or when a major change to the system or upgrades to the tools used occurs. In addition, OI&T conducts penetration testing quarterly on one-fourth of the total number of VA High Systems and/or internet facing systems. (A&A SOP, 4.2.11)

6.2.6 Security Compliance Configuration Data (SCCD)The System Owner or delegate contacts ISRM at  vaoisisrmrmf@va.gov to ensure the IP addresses or system names that make up their system(s) are appropriately tagged or accounted for in RiskVision.After reviewing information system boundaries for accuracy, System Owner/Delegate should run the Security Configuration Compliance Data (SCCD) Checklist Trending and Compliance Trending reports and export them to PDF from the EVVM Dashboard (https://dashboard.tic.va.gov > Enterprise > All Systems > Authorization & Accreditation).System Owner or Delegate uploads the Compliance Trending and Checklist Trending reports to the Documents tab in RiskVision. The Compliance Trending and Checklist Trending reports can be found at https://dashboard.tic.va.gov/s/28U/ and  https://dashboard.tic.va.gov/s/28T/, respectively.Important:  If the IS environment changes, the System Owner will need to contact ISRM to ensure the correct system(s) are tagged/untagged in RiskVision. Not informing ISRM of system inventory changes will result with incorrect SCCD scan reports.Continuous Monitoring Requirement – Security Configuration Compliance Data must be pulled in accordance with the guidance above on a quarterly basis, or when changes are made to the approved secure configuration/hardening guides, or when requested by OIS.(A&A SOP, 4.3.5)

6.3 Plan of Action and Milestone (POA&M) RemediationThe System Owner or delegate will address all weaknesses that have been identified during the assessment and scanning of the applicable application or system within RiskVision prior to submission for ATO. The System Owner or delegate will need to provide responses for the weakness that includes the remediation activities for the corrective actions or mitigation activities with associated milestones to correct the weaknesses.6.4 Authorizing Official System Brief (AOSB)The completion of the AOSB process is automated.  EPMOIA will send out the AOSB link that is specific to the system typically two weeks prior to the “45-Day” ATO expiration date.  The system’s AOSB link is sent to the System Owner and ISO. For further information, contact EPMOIA@va.gov.Initial ATOs will go through a similar process.  The progression of the RiskVision workflow will prompt for an AOSB to be completed.
